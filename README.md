# React + Vite

This React application allows users to view the product, select the quantity of the product they want to purchase, and see the updated subtotal and total price. It demonstrates how to manage state using React context API.

The ItemList component is responsible for displaying the product with it's description, price, and quantities. It allows users to select the quantity of the product they want to purchase and dynamically updates the subtotal and total price based on the selected quantity.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
